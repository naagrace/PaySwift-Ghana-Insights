## 📌 Problem Statement  
PaySwift Ghana, a small fintech company, provides mobile payments, micro-loans, and personal finance management tools. However, it faces three major challenges:  
1. Low adoption rates for new features.  
2. High loan default rates among customers.  
3. Significant churn, with many users disengaging after a short period.

## 🎯 Business Objective  
To use data to answer:  
- How can PaySwift increase **feature adoption**?  
- How can it **reduce loan defaults**?  
- How can it **improve customer retention**?  

---

## 🔍 My Approach  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed missing values
   - Standardized repayment statuses and risk scores.  
 
2. **Dashboard Design**
   -Created calculated columns and measures in Power BI for data visualization

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used  
- **Excel** → Initial cleaning & exploration  
- **Power BI** → Interactive dashboard creation  


---

## 📊 Key Insights  
- **Feature Usage**: Budgeting Tool, Loan Services, Mobile Payments, and Savings Tracker were the most selected, but **Investment Advice drove the highest transactions**.  
- **Repayment Patterns**: Loan Services were strongly linked with defaults; Youth and Young Adults showed the weakest repayment behavior.  
- Older Adults had the best repayment behavior and lowest churn.

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations  
1. **Increase Feature Adoption**  
   - Promote high-engagement features (Budgeting Tools, Investment Advice) with age-targeted campaigns.  
   - Introduce incentives and nudges for underused features (e.g., cashback for first-time use).  

2. **Reduce Loan Defaults**  
   - Cap first-time loan amounts for new/high-risk users.  
   - Add stricter credit checks and tailored repayment options.  
   - Provide in-app financial education for Youth.  

3. **Improve Customer Retention**  
   - Re-engage at-risk users (especially Youth & high-risk customers) with targeted messaging.  
   - Encourage multi-feature use to deepen engagement.  
   - Reward loyalty with milestone badges or benefits.  
  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps  
- Test predictive models to forecast churn and default risk.  
- Explore A/B testing for feature promotions and incentive structures.  
- Automate reporting pipelines for real-time monitoring.

✨ This project demonstrates how **data storytelling and visualization** can guide fintech strategy — helping PaySwift align product design with user behavior to improve adoption, reduce defaults, and retain more customers.
